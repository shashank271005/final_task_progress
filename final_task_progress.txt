I have started designing my product webpage design, but major part is yet to begin, till now I had only figured out on the outline of design and currently thinking about what can be done next.

This is a design of a webpage  showcasing mercedes AMG car, store etc...
I had tried to host the design using a free figma plugin, which doesn't produces good results, but instead check my figma design.
